## Development halted

Ajellito/Agilito has turned into a one-man project, and that leaves to
little opportunity for load-sharing and feedback. I have shifted all
my efforts to [Redmine Backlogs 2.1](http://github.com/relaxdiego/redmine_backlogs/tree/2.1). 
I have included a tool in the ajellito sources (toyaml.py) that will
allow you to dump your projects in a format that can be imported
cleanly into Redmine Backlogs. Redmine provides a richer base for what
Ajellito/Agilito set to achieve; in a mere two weeks I've replicated
everything that was in Ajellito/Agilito in Redmine, and gained all
that redmine has to offer in the process, so as far as I'm concerned
this move is final. I'll keep this repository up for those still
interested in its source.
